- 👋 Hi, I’m Roya Baratifarimani
- 👀 I’m interested in Physics
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Master Science of Condensed Matter Physics in Tarbitat Modares University of Tehran, actually I am working on nanoscale heat transfer specially nonlocal dual phase lag model that is one of the phenomonological methods for nanoscale heat transfer , as you know in this scale fourier law does not work and we should modify fourier law for nanoscale heat transfer.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Heat transfer groups
